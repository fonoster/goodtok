# Introduction

Self-hosting Goodtok involves running the Goodtok server on your server. Self-hosting is useful if you want to run Goodtok on a private network or if you want to customize Goodtok's behavior. While this offers more flexibility, it also requires more technical knowledge, and some features may not be available.
