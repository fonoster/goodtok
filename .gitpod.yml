## This '.gitpod.yml' file when placed at the root of a project instructs
## Gitpod how to prepare & build the project, start development environments
## and configure continuous prebuilds. Prebuilds when enabled builds a project
## like a CI server so you can start coding right away - no more waiting for
## dependencies to download and builds to finish when reviewing pull-requests
## or hacking on something new.
